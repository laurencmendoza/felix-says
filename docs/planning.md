# Simon - Project 1 Planning
by: Lauren C. Mendoza
## Game Choice - Simon

I'm planning on recreating Simon, but with my cat, Felix, at the top, who will help deliver the sequence with his meows.

## Psuedocode

1.  Define required constants

2.  Define required variables used to track the state of the game

3.  Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable and performant.

4.  Upon loading the app should:
   Initialize the state variables
   Render those values to the page
   Play the first sequence
   Wait for the user to click a button

5.  Handle a player clicking a button

6.  Handle a player clicking the start over button
